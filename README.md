### Lessons Learned

I learned that simple mistake is easy to make and can throw off the rest of your program. The way I caught my mistake this time around
was to actually write out on paper what calculation and steps my computer was doing as it ran through my program.

I learned I make things too complicated if I don't take the time to just think about it. I need to take the time to map things out.

I learned I should explore all avenues before I commit myself to one thing.

I think I forced myself to learn to navigate nested statements and what the output will be. 

Next time, I'll remember if it feels to complicated, then it probably is and maybe I should take a step back and re-evaluate my life choices.
